if we all had windows 10 professional, or linux, we could install real docker.
but non-pro windows 10 doesn't support containers (yet?) so, we have Docker Toolbox.

Docker Toolbox is meant to be one-click setup for running Linux containers on Windows using a small Linux virtual machine.

docker pull <image-name>
    just downloads the image (or updates, if there's some new version)
    this will happen automatically at the start of a docker build if needed, though
docker build <dir>
    <dir> will be the build context (the files sent to Docker to base the image on with the Dockerfile)
    usually we cd to that directory beforehand anyway, so <dir> is "." (current directory)
    use "-t <image+tag>" to tag the image like "ConsoleApp:1.0".
    use "-f <filepath>" to point to a Dockerfile. (the default is [buildcontext]/Dockerfile)
docker run <image-name>
    this starts a new container from the given image (downloading that image if necessary)
    "-it" options after "run" we need when the CMD is some shell like bash,
        to attach the container's input to the current terminal's input.
    "-d" option, alternative to "-it", detach container from current terminal (run in background)
    (without either of those options, console input may not work, and
        Ctrl+C just detaches from the container, rather than stopping)
docker container ls
    show all running containers
    "-a" option: show all running or stopped containers
docker container prune
    remove all stopped containers
docker run --rm <image-name>
    run container, and clean it up as soon as it has stopped
docker stop <container-id>
    stop a running container.
docker rm <container-id>
    clean up a stopped container
docker rm -f <container-id>
    stop and clean up container
docker images ls
    show all images downloaded
docker logs <container-id>
    look at console output of a container
docker exec <container-id> <command>
    run an additional command inside running container to look around/debug

docker image:
    template for container to start
    has the whole file system
    has a pointer to some program inside the image that should run
        when we start the container
    images are LAYERED - every image has some base image, adding
        new layers on top of it

Dockerfile:
    provides instructions to build a new image from some base image.
    FROM:
        sets the base image to use for subsequent layers
    WORKDIR
    COPY
    RUN
    CMD
    ENTRYPOINT
    ARG
    ENV
    EXPOSE

when we do a docker build:

1. the entire directory contents (the "build context") is sent to the docker daemon.
2. then, we run each command in the dockerfile.
3. any COPY commands use that build context for the source.

we can use .dockerignore to hide files from that step 1.
