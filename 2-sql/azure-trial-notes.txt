for the next month:
    you'll have a "Free Trial" subscription
    you start with a $200 credit on your account
    if that $200 runs out, you will be charged.
for the 11 months after that:
    at the transition, you'll need to opt in
        to a "Pay-As-You-Go" subscription
    anything left of the $200 vanishes
    certain Azure services remain free
after all 12 months are over:
    most of those Azure services are no longer free.

check the billing center in the azure portal to make sure you're not spending more than you want to.
