            // we have a desire to keep data persistent while the program is not running
            // or maybe, to share the same data source across multiple copies of the running program.

            // one way we can achieve that is with serialization to files like we coded last week, with XML, JSON, etc.

            // there are various problems with that approach.
            // it's slow: to change one thing, i have to load the whole file, deserialize the whole file,
            // reserialize the whole thing, and write it back to disk

            // way 1 to store data: C# objects (reference types, value types, fields/properties have object-to-object
            //  references... collections (convenient, works well with code, but not persistent
            // way 2 to store data: serialized as XML, JSON, or something similar (persistent, but awkward)
            // way 3: relational database (SQL database)
            // it's persistent, but it's very well optimized for querying data without having to load
            // anything beyond exactly the data you want. optimized for making changes quickly

            // how relational databases treat data, what are the basic buliding blocks
            // tables, rows, and columns.
            // one table for each kind of data
            // a table has one column for each property that kind of data can have
            // each row has some value for each column, because it represents one instance of that kind of data.

            // because tables, rows, and columns are quite different to how C# represents objects,
            // just like how we used a serializer library (System.Text.Json) to handle the translation details,
            // we'll use something called an ORM (object-relational mapper) to handle that with SQL databases.

            // in .NET, the main ORM is Entity Framework.
            //    in .NET Framework, we're up to EF 6.
            //    in .NET Core, we're up to EF Core 3.1 (same version as .NET Core itself)

            // EF Core does come from Microsoft, but it isn't part of CoreFx (the Standard Libraries)...
            // it's a handful of other assemblies, and .NET Core lets us use NuGet to automatically manage
            // any dependencies like that which we need to download and have connected to our own assemblies
            // so the CLR can run them.

            // in the command-line, we use `dotnet add <package>`
            // in VS, we can use the Package Manager GUI

            // when we run "dotnet run" or click run from visual studio...
            // 1. dotnet restore (tells nuget to download any missing packages)
            // 2. dotnet build (compiles the code to assemblies)
            // 3. dotnet run (runs the code in the CLR)
