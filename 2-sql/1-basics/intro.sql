-- we know what a relational database is

-- the standard way to interact with relational database is a language called SQL
-- (Structured Query Language)

-- SQL is very declarative - meaning, you don't say HOW you want to get the data
-- you just say the data you want, and the SQL server will calculate and plan the
--      fastest algorithms to go and get it

-- SQL variants
--  SQLite, Oracle SQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL

-- with SQL Server, technically, SQL Server is the name of the software that runs to manage the DB.
-- the *language* that you send is called Transact-SQL, aka T-SQL.

-- RDBMS relational database management system
