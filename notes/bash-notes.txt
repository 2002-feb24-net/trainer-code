bash is a shell program that lets us run many programs
    using a text-based interface.

some commands:
    cd <dir>
        change directory, can be absolute (like "/c/revature")
        or relative (like "my-project" in the current folder)
        ".." means, the parent of the current folder.
    ls <dir>
        list contents of a directory
        (or the current directory, by default)
    mkdir <dir>
        create a directory
    rm <path>
        delete a file
    rm -r <path>
        delete a directory
    mv <path1> <path2>
        rename/move a file/directory
