exercises:

1. if this is a staircase of size 3:
  #
 ##
###
    make a program that prints a staircase of size 8.
    (it should ascend up to the right, not descend down to the right.)

2. make a program that prints a staircase of any size, taking the number from Console.ReadLine.

3. make a program that prints the Collatz sequence (up until 1) for a given number,
    taking the number from Console.ReadLine.
    for any number n, the next number in its Collatz sequence is:
    - if n is even, it is n divided by two.
    - if n is odd, it is n times three, plus one.
    for example, for 10, you should print:
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
    the Collatz conjecture says, this process eventually reaches 1 for every number.
